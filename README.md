# AgroInsight- HackOut '24

## Overview
We participated in **HackOut '24**, where we developed an innovative project focused on enhancing agricultural practices in India. Our project provides critical insights into soil quality, suitable crops for different seasons, soil fertility, fertilizer, and pesticide recommendations, as well as soil improvement techniques tailored to various regions of India.

## Project Goals
- **Soil Quality Analysis:** Determine the quality of soil across different regions in India.
- **Crop Recommendations:** Suggest the best crops to plant in particular seasons based on soil data.
- **Soil Fertility:** Provide insights into soil fertility to optimize crop yield.
- **Fertilizer & Pesticide Recommendations:** Offer guidelines on appropriate fertilizer and pesticide usage.
- **Soil Improvement:** Suggest methods to improve soil quality over time.

## Data Collection
We gathered data from various reliable sources to ensure accurate and relevant information. This data served as the foundation for building our machine learning model and informed the recommendations provided by the system.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Django
- **Machine Learning Model:** Python
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **APIs:** Integrated various external APIs to enrich the dataset and improve the accuracy of recommendations.

## Machine Learning Model
We trained a machine learning model using the collected data to analyze soil quality and provide crop recommendations. The model processes input data and generates actionable insights for farmers.

## User Interface
The frontend is built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing an intuitive and responsive interface for users to interact with the system. The backend, powered by Django, handles data processing and API integration.

## Conclusion
Our project aims to empower farmers by providing them with data-driven insights and recommendations to enhance agricultural productivity. By leveraging technology, we hope to contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture in India.
